## About my app
I developed an app like this to show how much each country has been affected by the coronavirus outbreak.
I made different coloring in the navbar depending on which page the user is on.
The first view shows the deaths and lawsuits of all countries in the world.
The user can find the status of the country curious about by searching.
The second view shows the total destruction in the world.
The final view shows the damage caused by the virus in tabular form, divided by continents.
